This is my First Dynamic react app on git hub, It is the Clone of NETFLIX home page that shows dynamic contents by fetching data from TMDB APIs. <br>
Sources That I have used to build the apps are as follows: <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)Youtube video: [https://youtu.be/Y11HewNi3xc?si=bIQvz9-ONuO_E_b-] <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)APIs form TMDB website: [https://www.themoviedb.org/] <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3)Different Documentations.
